Falling,
I've been down here before
Almost like I'm back home
Fade,
slowly it all begins to fade
I got no power left today
I don't know, I don't know
if things would ever change
I think
I'll just be stuck here anyway
Those nights,
when your energy is nowhere
to be,
Nowhere to be found
Do you see the light?
Or does it
feel like abyss, oh,
it's bottomless
I'm tryna figure out
How to stay afloat
in this world and all
of its gravity
When everyday the pull is
grabbing me
And it's easy thinking
"Nobody
here's understanding me"
Maybe I'm not alone
Maybe I'm not alone
Aim, somewhere along,
I lost my aim
thoughtlessly counting up
my days
I don't know, I don't know
it's really tough to say
I'll probably be stuck here
anyway
Those nights,
when your energy is
to nowhere to be,
Nowhere to be found
Do you see the light?
Or does it
Feel like abyss, oh,
it's bottomless
I'm tryna figure out
How to stay afloat
in this world and all
of its gravity
When everyday the pull is
grabbing me
And it's easy thinking
"Nobody
here's understanding me"
Maybe I'm not alone
Maybe I'm not alone
And I know I'm
Not alone, not alone
All these faces
with the same frustrations
Not alone, not alone
Part of me, part of you,
we're not alone
Bet somebody's out there,
just like me
Feeling all the same things
I don't know what I should do
At least, though,
you're like this too
I've found a bit of comfort
Ah Ahh
How to stay afloat
in this world and all
of its gravity
When everyday the pull is
grabbing me
And it's easy thinking
"Nobody
here's understanding me"
Maybe I'm not alone
Maybe I'm not alone
And I know I'm
Not alone, not alone
All these faces
with the same frustrations
Not alone, not alone
Part of me, part of you,
we're not alone
